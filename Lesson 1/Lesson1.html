    <p>Hello, my name is Thomas Ferri. I'm currently pursuing a Web Design certificate at Wake Tech, having enrolled
        last Spring. When I'm not studying I can often be found working on my online bookstore, Blotto Von Sozzle Books.
        I specialize in rare vintage first editions, with storefronts on Etsy, Ebay, and Abebooks. Part of my reasoning
        for being here is that I want to eventually design a website for my bookstore. The rarest book I've ever sold
        was a true first edition copy of Robert Louis Stevenson's masterpiece "Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde" -
        only 1,200 copies of this edition were printed in 1886, with very few surviving to the present day. In addtion
        to books, my shop also sells vintage Polish film posters on occasion, and I'm currently considering posting
        vintage cassettes and cassette players on my shop as well.
